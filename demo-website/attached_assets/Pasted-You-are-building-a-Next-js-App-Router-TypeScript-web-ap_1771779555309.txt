You are building a Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript web app for “Wattr”, a data-centre intelligence demo. This phase is frontend-only with mock data (no backend). The site must feel like a calm, industrial control-room interface.

IMPORTANT VISUAL REFERENCES:

1. Use the attached isometric data-centre reference image as the scene/style anchor (racks + overhead piping + workstations).
2. Match Wattr brand colour from the attached logo: PRIMARY ACCENT = #70A0D0.

## Brand colour system (must follow)

* Primary (Wattr Blue): #70A0D0
* Primary Dark: #3872AC
* Primary Darker: #2C5985
* Primary Light: #9EBFDF
* Background: near-black / graphite (e.g. #0B0F14 to #121824 range)
* Heat accent (only for “high load”): #FF6A3D (sparingly)

Use these consistently:

* Buttons, focus rings, highlights, chart lines: Wattr Blue (#70A0D0)
* “Wattr ON” state: Wattr Blue
* Rack heatmap: blue→amber/orange only as load increases (never neon cyberpunk)

## Deliverable (Phase 1)

Build these routes:

1. `/` Home (WebGL-first)

* Full-screen React Three Fiber (R3F) scene inspired by the attached data-centre image.
* Scene: floor plane + rack clusters + simple “pipes” geometry overhead + a few desk/monitor blocks (primitive geometry OK).
* Lighting: realistic industrial; subtle blue/cyan tint using Wattr Blue.
* OrbitControls enabled (smooth + constrained).
* 4 clickable hotspots: “Server Room”, “Cooling Plant”, “Power Room”, “NOC”.

  * Clicking animates camera to preset views + shows a small overlay panel with 2–3 metrics.
* Add a workload slider (0–150) that changes rack “heat” visually:

  * Low load: emissive/accents in Wattr Blue (#70A0D0)
  * Higher load: gradually shifts toward warmer tones (use #FF6A3D sparingly) and increases emissive intensity
* Below the hero: scroll section with left-side controls and right-side live 3D preview reacting in real time.

2. `/noc` Operations View

* Mock NOC dashboard:

  * Left: rack grid map with status tiles (green/yellow/red)
  * Center: Recharts time-series (next 6 hours) for Thermal Load + Water Draw (mock data)
  * Right: Alerts + Recommended Actions (mock)
* Toggle “Wattr On/Off” changes KPI deltas + chart lines (mock differences only).
* Charts + key highlights must use Wattr Blue for the primary series.

3. `/technology`

* Clean architecture explanation: IT Telemetry → Forecast Engine → Simulation → Recommendations → Control Interface
* Use cards/diagram-like layout (no images required) with Wattr Blue accents.

4. `/contact`

* Minimal form UI (no submission needed) + “In active development” note.

## Tech constraints

* Next.js App Router + TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS (shadcn/ui optional)
* three + @react-three/fiber + @react-three/drei
* Zustand store: workload, ambientTemp, waterCostIndex, aiBurst, wattrEnabled, scenario
* Recharts for charts
* Performance: lazy-load the 3D canvas, show a loading state, keep it smooth.

## Output requirements

* Provide full file structure + key code files.
* Include exact install commands.
* Ensure it runs in Replit without extra configuration.
* Use local mock data generators in `lib/`.

Build `/` first, then `/noc`, then the simple pages. The whole UI + scene must stay consistent with Wattr Blue (#70A0D0) and the attached isometric data-centre reference.
